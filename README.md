[Type parameters](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md) or Generics
in Go designed to reduce boilerplate for container data types like lists, graphs, etc. and functions like map, filter, reduce...

But it's possible to use them in other (I've named them 'unusual') cases. I'm collecting such cases in this repository.

Feel free to open issue or pull request to add new one.
